# canvas-svg-project
A page with some description of basic elements of Canvas and SVG.
Here you may see how to use blur effect, text, drop shadows and stroke in Canvas. 
Also there are SVG's rectangle, polyline, circle and text.
Most of the examples are based on the ones from https://www.w3schools.com. 
Much of thanks to the authors of these articles: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/filter and https://www.w3resource.com/html5-canvas/html5-canvas-shadow.php.
